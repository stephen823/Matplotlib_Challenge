# Matplotlib_Challenge
Pymaceuticals Inc is a company that specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. It needs to screen the performances of their four potential treatment drugs for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). 

In this project, I am aiming to compare the performance of 4 regimens in terms of treating the SSC tumour. After manipulation and analysis of data involved in a trial of 250 mice, obtained insight is visualized through maplotlib.
